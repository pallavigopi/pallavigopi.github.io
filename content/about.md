**Hello world, I’m Pallavi 👋🏼!**

I write code, lift weights, and never say no to a spontaneous adventure 👩🏻‍💻💪🏼⛰️. 

With over 4 years of experience in backend development, I love building things that work smoothly and geeking out over how to make systems even better. When I’m not in front of a screen, I’m either smashing shuttlecocks 🏸, hitting the gym, or chasing my wanderlust wherever it takes me.

Cold brew in hand ☕, gym bag in the other—I’m all about balance, whether it’s life or code!
